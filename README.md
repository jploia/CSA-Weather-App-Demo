This file will be in the directory you are currently in (likely your user directory). You can see what directory you're in from your terminal.

**IF YOU DON'T HAVE A GITHUB ACCOUNT...**
1. Create and name a folder in the directory of your choice (for example, go into Documents).
2. Click on the folder twice to open it.
3. In the folder, you will create three new files: 
`index.html`, `script.js`, and `style.css`
4. Once you have made these files, find the corresponding file on this GitHub and copy the code on to your personal file to follow along.
